# Task-4: Speech Recognition System

## Objective
To implement a speech recognition based command control
system using a virtual environment.

## Description
This project demonstrates a basic speech recognition
workflow using Python. Audio input is processed and
commands are identified to control a virtual device.

## Platform Used
Python (Virtual Implementation)

## Features
- Speech recognition using Python
- Command-based control logic
- Fully virtual implementation

## Output
The system processes audio input and displays the
corresponding device status.

## Note
This project is implemented in a virtual environment.
Audio input is generated programmatically to demonstrate
the speech recognition workflow without physical hardware.
