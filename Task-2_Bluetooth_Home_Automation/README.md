# Task-2: Home Automation with Bluetooth

## Internship
CodTech Technologies – Embedded Systems Internship

## Objective
To design a Bluetooth-controlled home automation system
that can switch devices ON and OFF wirelessly.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- LED (used as appliance)
- Resistor
- Jumper Wires

## Working Principle
Bluetooth commands are simulated using the Arduino Serial
Monitor due to the limitation of online simulation platforms.
Arduino receives control commands and switches the connected
device accordingly.

## Control Commands
- '1' → Device ON
- '0' → Device OFF

## Output
The Serial Monitor displays the device status, and the LED
turns ON or OFF based on the received command.

## Platform Used
Wokwi Arduino Simulator
